I am a research scientist with Salesforce AI Research. I was part of the MIN LAB, advised by Prof. Hongkai Xiong and Prof. Weiyao Lin. I was a visiting student of <a href="https://ccvl.jhu.edu/">CCVL LAB</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/">Alan Yuille</a>. Prior to SJTU, I obtained my B.S. degree in <a href="http://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/">Chien-Shiung Wu College</a> from Southeast University in 2016.
